<h3>SUSHI GO</h3>

<p>Sushi Go is a fast-playing card game in which the goal is to collect the best combination of sushi dishes as they pass through your hand. You score points by making the most maki rolls or for collecting a full set of shashimi. Dip your nigiri in some wasabi to triple your points. But donâ€™t forget that dessert is being served and will eat into your score. Gather as many points as possible, and if you collect the most, you win!</p>
